				  Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009
				  In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
				- The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
				- HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
				- Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
				- After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]
				- Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.

				- HTML 2
					- November 24, 1995
					  HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
					  November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
					  May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
					  August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
					  January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)
				- HTML 3
					- January 14, 1997
					  HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
					  Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
				- HTML 4
					- December 18, 1997
					  HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
					  Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
					  Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
					  Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
					  Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]
					  April 24, 1998
					  HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
					  December 24, 1999
					  HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata[22] were published on May 12, 2001.
					  May 2000
					  ISO/IEC 15445:2000[23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.[24] In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[23]
					  After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.
				- HTML 5

	- # CSS introduction:
	  collapsed:: true
		- introduction:
		  collapsed:: true
			- CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It was introduced to the web development community to separate the structure and content of a webpage from its visual presentation. Here is a brief history of CSS:
			- Timeline:
				- 1. **Early Days (1990s):**
				- In the early days of the World Wide Web, web designers used HTML to structure the content of a webpage. However, HTML had limited capabilities for controlling the appearance of the content.
				- 2. **HTML Style Attributes:**
				- To address the limitations of HTML, developers began using inline style attributes within HTML tags to control the visual presentation of elements. This approach, however, led to messy and difficult-to-maintain code.
				- 3. **Emergence of CSS (1996):**
				- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recognized the need for a separate styling language, leading to the development of CSS. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos presented the first draft of the CSS specification in 1996.
				- 4. **CSS Level 1 (1996):**
				- The first official CSS specification, CSS Level 1, was published by the W3C in December 1996. It provided basic styling capabilities like font properties, text alignment, and colors.
				- 5. **CSS Level 2 (1998-2009):**
				- CSS Level 2 was introduced to address various issues and enhance the capabilities of CSS. It brought features like positioning, floating elements, and media types. The first edition was published in 1998, and subsequent editions followed, with the final Recommendation in 2009.
				- 6. **CSS3 and Modularization (2011 Onwards):**
				- Instead of releasing a single monolithic specification, the W3C adopted a modular approach for CSS3, allowing for the development and release of individual modules as they became ready. This approach facilitated a more gradual evolution of the language.
				- 7. **CSS4 and Future Developments:**
				- The concept of CSS4 is less defined compared to previous versions, as the modular approach allows for continuous updates without waiting for a complete specification. CSS is an evolving standard, and new features and improvements are regularly proposed and implemented.
				- 8. **Browser Support and Vendor Prefixes:**
				- During the development of CSS3, browser vendors implemented experimental features with vendor prefixes (e.g., -webkit- for WebKit browsers like Chrome and Safari). This practice allowed developers to experiment with emerging features but also led to some compatibility challenges.
				- 9. **Current State (2022):**
				- CSS is an integral part of web development, with widespread support across browsers. Developers use CSS to create responsive and visually appealing layouts, animations, and other design elements on websites.
				  
				  Throughout its history, CSS has played a crucial role in enhancing the design and layout capabilities of web pages, contributing to the overall evolution of the web development landscape.
	- # Javascript Introduction:
	  collapsed:: true
		- introduction:
			- JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for building interactive and dynamic web pages. Here's a brief history of JavaScript:
			- **Birth of JavaScript (1995):**
				- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. The language was initially named Mocha, then briefly LiveScript before finally being named JavaScript.
				- The first version of JavaScript was released in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995.
			- **JavaScript at Microsoft (1996-1997):**
				- Microsoft recognized the potential of JavaScript and created a compatible version called JScript for Internet Explorer.
				- This led to a period where web developers had to deal with browser compatibility issues, as different browsers supported different versions of JavaScript.
			- **Standardization (1997-1999):**
				- In 1997, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization. The result was ECMAScript, the standard upon which JavaScript is based.
				- ECMAScript 3, published in 1999, became the first widely adopted version and established a more standardized foundation for JavaScript development.
			- **DOM and AJAX (2000s):**
				- The Document Object Model (DOM) was introduced, allowing dynamic manipulation of web page content. This enabled developers to update and change the content of a page without requiring a full page reload.
				- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) emerged as a technique for creating more responsive and dynamic web applications by allowing data to be retrieved asynchronously from the server.
			- **ECMAScript 5 (2009):**
				- ECMAScript 5 brought significant improvements and additions to the language, enhancing capabilities and addressing some of the quirks in earlier versions.
			- **Node.js (2009):**
				- Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, was released. It allowed developers to use JavaScript for both client and server-side development, promoting the concept of "JavaScript everywhere."
			- **ECMAScript 6 (ES2015) and Beyond:**
				- ECMAScript 6, released in 2015, introduced several new features, including arrow functions, classes, and modules.
				- Subsequent versions of ECMAScript have continued to bring additional features and improvements to the language.
			- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
				- Various JavaScript frameworks and libraries have gained popularity, such as Angular, React, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Node.js for server-side development.
			- **JavaScript in Modern Development:**
				- JavaScript has become a fundamental technology in modern web development, with its role expanding to include mobile app development (React Native, Ionic), server-side scripting (Node.js), and even desktop applications (Electron).
			- # Javascript Engine:
				- **V8 (Chrome, Node.js):**
					- Developed by Google, V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine that powers the Chrome browser and Node.js. It's known for its speed and efficiency.
					- V8 translates JavaScript code into machine code for faster execution using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
					- It supports modern JavaScript features and is continuously updated to improve performance.
				- **SpiderMonkey (Firefox):**
					- Developed by Mozilla, SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript engine used in the Firefox browser.
					- It was one of the first JavaScript engines ever created, and it has evolved to support various web standards and features.
				- **JavaScriptCore (WebKit/Safari):**
					- JavaScriptCore, also known as Nitro, is the JavaScript engine used in the WebKit rendering engine, which powers the Safari browser.
					- It is an open-source engine that includes the Nitro JIT compiler for faster execution.
				- **Chakra (Microsoft Edge):**
					- Chakra was the JavaScript engine used in the Microsoft Edge browser before it transitioned to the Chromium engine.
					- It supported Just-In-Time compilation and aimed for fast performance in web applications.
				- **Rhino:**
					- Rhino is an open-source JavaScript engine written in Java. It is often embedded in Java applications to allow scripting with JavaScript.
					- While not as fast as some of the engines mentioned earlier, it is a versatile option for certain use cases.
				- **JerryScript:**
					- JerryScript is a lightweight, open-source JavaScript engine designed for resource-constrained devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
					- It is developed to be highly efficient in terms of both memory usage and processing power.
				- **Nashorn (Deprecated):**
					- Nashorn was the JavaScript engine included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) until Java 11. It has been deprecated in favor of GraalVM.
				- **GraalVM:**
					- GraalVM is a high-performance runtime that supports multiple languages, including JavaScript. It can be used as a standalone engine or embedded in Java applications.

		- [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)
		- [HTMLAttributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute)
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Required Attributes:**
				- These are essential attributes that must be specified for an element to function correctly.
				- The absence of required attributes might lead to improper rendering or dysfunctional behavior of the element.
				- Example: The `src` attribute for the `<img>` element is required to specify the source of the image.
			- **Optional Attributes:**
				- These attributes are not mandatory but can be used to modify or enhance the default behavior of an element.
				- They provide additional information or customization options.
				- Example: The `alt` attribute for the `<img>` element is optional but is recommended for providing alternative text for accessibility.
			- **Standard Attributes:**
				- These attributes are supported by a wide range of HTML elements, providing common functionality across different element types.
				- Examples include `id`, `class`, `style`, and `title`.
				- They are not specific to a particular type of element but can be used across various elements.
			- **Event Attributes:**
				- These attributes are used to associate JavaScript code or scripts with specific events triggered by the element.
				- They enable the execution of custom scripts in response to user actions or other events.
				- Examples include `onclick`, `onmouseover`, and `onchange`.
		- [Sematic tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
		  collapsed:: true
			- ## What are Semantic Elements?
			  
			  A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
			  
			  Examples of **non-semantic** elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.
			  
			  Examples of **semantic** elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.
